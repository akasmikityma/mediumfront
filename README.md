# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

##  auth ==> 

   1> only logged in users are able to get the posts that the app has to offer and then .. it has the functionality to post a new post by creating at the CreatePost page and then >> 

   do i show the users post on the same page as the page where the other users post are listed or not>>>>

   ==>> he made Auth as the cell of the body >> so he made Auth in a way that a type string can be Passed and then 
   wrote 2 more Comps -SignUP , SignIN and called the Auth Comp there giving the type according to the comp > 

   Pages __________>> [All_these_routes_are_protected]
   
   1 > all the Posts Containing Page 
   2 > single Post's elaborative page 
   3 > write A post page 


   blog page is different .. it cant be the cell for the blogs comp  >>>>
   

   only 2 things left more or less +++>>>>

   Updation of a post ==
   Deletion of a Post ==

   deletion -- i can give a button icon in the cell post and then add a method there 

   updation can be another page thing kind of same as the the Create Post page and the clicking some button may get the job done>>


   tasks --> 
    have a loader comp and utilize the loader atom whenever the task is taking some time >

    have some nice notifications that tells the user .. what happened to the event they did>>

    {what if i delete the posts locally untill the user refreshes the page .. it can be faster in rendering the remaining posts that are left there>>}
